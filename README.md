# Project details

1. I have used multiple css files which can be fit confusing for person seeing project for the first time, navigate to the paths and you can find them easily while most of the css is in app.css

2. I have not implemented the payment that is just a static representation.
3. Note that all the data is in the localstorage (i am using the store ofcourse for an easy access) but to store the data temporary and doesn't gets lost with page refresh i used localstorage.
4. Used flowbite component for the navbar and modal.
5. used custom hook for api calls
6. used tailwind classes too.
7. Note : I have implemented the minimum order functionlality yet so if you will try to order products below minimum quantity that wont show any error.
